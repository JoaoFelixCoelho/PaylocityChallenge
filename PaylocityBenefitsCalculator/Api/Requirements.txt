What are we looking for?

 - understanding of business requirements
 - correct implementation of requirements
 - test coverage for the cost calculations
 - code/architecture quality
 - plan for future flexibility
 - address "task" code comments

What should you not waste time on?

 - authentication/authorization
 - input sanitization
 - logging
 - adding multiple projects to represent layers... putting everything in the API project is fine
